      <p className="mb-10">
        While Novartis has pursued bold portfolio change, core elements of our
        company remain the same. Our vision is to become the most trusted and
        valued medicines company in the world – valued not only for our business
        performance, but also for the difference our innovation makes for
        patients and society.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-10">
        The world is counting on us to succeed. Fewer than 10% of diseases known
        to affect humans are currently treatable, and globally, people live an
        average of 10 years with a disease or disability. Yet new treatments
        broadly still reach only a fraction of eligible patients, and manageable
        conditions like heart disease cause millions of avoidable deaths each
        year.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-10">
        Our performance in 2022 showed that we are making progress in addressing
        society’s greatest disease burdens. Our focus on cardiovascular disease,
        for example, gives countries and healthcare systems solutions to address
        the world’s leading cause of death and disability. Entresto, our
        medicine for heart failure and hypertension, is estimated to be treating
        around 10 million patients worldwide, while our cholesterol-lowering
        siRNA treatment Leqvio is now approved in 70 countries.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-10">
        We saw robust growth momentum across our in-market medicines. This
        includes stronger-than-expected uptake in the US for Pluvicto, our novel
        radioligand therapy for advanced prostate cancer, highlighting our
        ability to turn the promise of next-generation medicines into a reality
        for patients.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-10">
        Despite challenging macroeconomic conditions and an unstable
        geopolitical environment, we delivered a solid financial performance
        that underscores the progress we are making, with 4% growth in net sales
        in constant currencies (cc) and 8% growth (cc) in core operating income
        compared with the previous year. Looking ahead, we aim to generate sales
        growth of 4% CAGR over the next five years, and grow above peer median
        beyond 2027.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-10">
        Our investments in R&D are key to achieving these ambitions. In 2022, we
        saw a positive Phase III readout for iptacopan, which was discovered at
        NIBR, in a rare and deadly blood disorder. We saw an important positive
        Phase III result for Pluvicto in earlier lines of prostate cancer. And
        we also reported positive Phase III results for Cosentyx in hidradenitis
        suppurativa, offering the potential to expand one of our most successful
        medicines and bring a new treatment option to patients with this painful
        skin disease.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-10">
        As we continue innovating for patients, millions around the world are
        still without proper access to healthcare. Translating the latest
        science into lasting progress requires us to work with healthcare
        systems and other stakeholders to advance access for underserved
        patients in low- and middle-income countries, while also tackling access
        barriers in some of the wealthiest countries in the world.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-10">
        In the US, for example, we expanded our 10-year Beacon of Hope
        initiative, which seeks to address racial disparities in healthcare,
        including by increasing diversity among clinical trial participants and
        investigators. We also pledged to invest USD 250 million in R&D for the
        treatment of malaria and neglected tropical diseases, building on our
        decades-long commitment to global health priorities. We continue to make
        progress in other aspects of our ESG agenda, including reducing
        greenhouse gas emissions from our own operations by nearly half since
        2016.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-10">
        As we look to the future as a focused medicines company, our dedication
        to innovation and excellence will drive us forward. We have set clear
        growth ambitions and we are confident we will meet them. Through
        reshaping Novartis, we are set to reimagine medicine for decades to
        come.

          Many of the most acute issues are in low- and middle-income countries

          diseases (NCDs), as well as fragile and under-resourced health
          systems. But the COVID-19 pandemic also exposed deep health inequities
          in higher-income countries, where barriers to access are often linked
          to structural health system issues as well as demographic, social, and
          economic challenges.

          committed to increasing access to medicines for decades. Over the
          years, we have moved from a donations-based approach to one that
          employs a combination of access models for more sustainable social
          impact. In 2022, our access programs and initiatives reached 54.6

          through our global health programs declined by 5% from the prior year,
          driven by increased availability of generic alternatives due to the
          easing of COVID-19-related supply disruptions in the wider industry.

          Our approach
        </h3>
        <p className="mb-30">
          To achieve our targets, we work to improve access for patients across
          the lifecycle of our medicines. We are guided by the Novartis Access
          Principles, which commit us to systematically integrate access
          strategies in how we research, develop and deliver our new medicines.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-30">
          These strategies include innovative approaches to affordability, such
          as sustainable business models and value-based pricing, as well as
          efforts to adapt medicines for different patient groups or for diverse
          environments. While affordability and availability remain key issues,
          the ability of health systems to effectively use innovative medicines
          is another critical barrier to access.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-30">
          In 2022, we pledged additional funding for research into new medicines
          for neglected tropical diseases. We became the first pharmaceutical
          company to contribute an innovative medicine to the ATOM Coalition to
          treat chronic myeloid leukemia (see "

          >

          "). We also expanded our 20-year collaboration with the Max Foundation
          to drive access to our innovative breast cancer treatment, in addition
          to chronic myeloid leukemia, and we launched key partnerships with
          health systems in both high-income countries and LMICs.
