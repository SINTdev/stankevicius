        Stankevicius International has been closely involved in international
        trade sector over the past several years. After being working on
        hundreds of international trade deals as third party consultant in
        variomainstream industries such as pharmaceutical and medical fields,
        oil gas, precious metals, agriculture and soft commodities, we realized
        ttrade business as a whole is, in fact, facing massive issues on a
        globscale.

        Since the start of Covid-19, Stankevicius International actively engaged
        in conducting trade business in pharmaceutical and medical equipments
        sectors. Even prior to covid, our group was already engaged in commodity
        trading in 2016 in oil & gas and precious metal sectors.

      <div className="w-full text-left text-lg leading-relaxed tracking-normal text-black">
        During our early days in 2016, we understood that the general trading
        can be difficult and trust is hard to be found. Fraud was essential in
        the industry back in the days and it was one of the main reasons we had
        not participated in trading again till 2020.

      <div className="py-4"></div>
      <div className="w-full text-left text-lg leading-relaxed tracking-normal text-black">
        5 years later, when Covid started, to our surprise we have faced the
        same issues in the industry as before, and the issues had gone much
        worse.

      <div className="py-4"></div>
      <div className="w-full text-left text-lg leading-relaxed tracking-normal text-black">
        Today we see, international trade sector being taken advantage of. The
        fraud market is as big as the real actual market, and both combined make
        international trade economy a huge bubble of opportunity and risk.
      </div>
      <div className="py-4"></div>
      <div className="w-full text-left text-lg leading-relaxed tracking-normal text-black">
        Over the years, we have seen many companies trying to disrupt, penetrate
        and influence the trade market but the reality outcome was that market
        always showed strength even when fighting against fraud.

      <div className="py-4"></div>
      <div className="w-full text-left text-lg leading-relaxed tracking-normal text-black">
        We see newcomers making mistakes in the market by trusting too early too
        soon. In physical commodity trading good offers always are sitting on
        the corner waiting as a bait but only with enough experience and
        knowledge one can detect misconduct.

        International trade market is huge, and in this market we are dealing
        with international companies from mix cultures, regions and continents
        complying with different laws and jurisdictions. It doesn’t matter where
        you are from or where your company is based at, when you are entering
        international market you are most likely going to deal with a total
        opposite of what you expect or use to deal with locally in your own
        region.

        At Stankevicius International, one of the main things we do is security
        and due diligence. We focus a lot on terms of contracting and
        supervision of entire trade deal execution.
